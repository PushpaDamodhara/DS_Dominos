📈 Problem Statement
Dominos wants to optimize the process of ordering ingredients by predicting future sales and creating a purchase order. By accurately forecasting sales, Dominos can ensure that it has the right amount of ingredients in stock, minimizing waste and preventing stockouts. This project aims to leverage historical sales data and ingredient information to develop a predictive model and generate an efficient purchase order system.

🎯 Objective:
To Develop a predictive model to forecast pizza sales.
To Create a purchase order system that calculates the required quantities of ingredients based on the sales forecast.
🔍 Dataset Overview
The project involves two datasets: Pizza Sales and Pizza Ingredients.

The Pizza Sales Dataset Historical sales records (Date, Pizza Type, Quantity Sold, Price, Category, Ingredients).

The Pizza Ingredients Dataset Ingredient requirements for each pizza type (Pizza Type, Ingredient, Quantity Needed).

📊 Metrics
Mean Absolute Percentage Error : Used to evaluate the accuracy of forecasting models. It measures the average absolute percentage error between the predicted values and the actual values.
💡 Business Use Cases
Inventory Management: Ensuring optimal stock levels to meet future demand without overstocking.
Cost Reduction: Minimizing waste and reducing costs associated with expired or excess inventory.
Sales Forecasting: Accurately predicting sales trends to inform business strategies and promotions.
Supply Chain Optimization: Streamlining the ordering process to align with predicted sales and avoid disruptions.
🛠️ Approach
I. Data Preprocessing
Data Cleaning ensures the dataset's accuracy and consistency through:

Handling Missing Data:

Detected missing values.
Replaced missing values using mean, median, mode, or placeholders.
Removed columns or rows with excessive missing data if necessary.
Removing Inconsistent Data:

Checked for format consistency and valid ranges.
Fixed inconsistencies, such as standardizing text and correcting typos.
Handling Outliers:

Identified outliers using statistical methods or visualizations.
Removed, transformed, or categorized outliers based on their impact.
II. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) discovers patterns, relationships, and anomalies in the data.

i) Top-Selling Pizzas
This visualization highlights the top 10 most popular pizzas based on total sales.
It helps identify which pizzas are in highest demand among customers.
The y-axis represents different pizza names, while the x-axis shows the quantity sold.
ii) Distribution of Pizza Categories:
This visualization displays the distribution of pizza orders across various categories (e.g., vegetarian, meat-lovers).
It provides insights into customer preferences and trends by category.
The y-axis represents different pizza categories, while the x-axis shows the number of orders for each category.
iii) Sales Trends Over Time:
This visualization shows daily pizza sales over time by converting the order_date column into a datetime format.
It helps identify trends, seasonality, and sales spikes throughout the observed period.
The line plot illustrates the quantity of pizzas sold each day.
iv) Sales by Day of the Week
This visualization aggregates total sales by day of the week to identify which days generate the most revenue.
The data is grouped by day_of_week, summing the total_price for each day.
The x-axis represents the days of the week (ordered from Monday to Sunday), while the y-axis shows the total sales for each day.
The bar plot helps pinpoint trends in customer purchasing behavior throughout the week.
III. Sales Prediction
Sales Prediction involves Time Series Forecasting, a technique used to predict future values based on historical data collected over time. The process includes the following steps:

i) Feature Engineering
Created new variables from the raw sales data to improve the model’s performance, such as:

Day of the Week: Extracted the day of the week from the sales date to capture weekly variations.
Month: Extracted the month from the sales date to account for monthly trends and seasonal patterns.
Holiday Effects: Identified and included features for holidays or special events that can impact sales patterns.
ii) Model Selection
Model Selection involves choosing the most suitable forecasting model for our sales data:

ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average): Captures trends and autocorrelations in non-seasonal data.
SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA): Extends ARIMA to handle seasonality.
iii) Model Training
Model Training involves fitting the chosen model to historical sales data:

Split the data into training and test sets to evaluate model performance.
Trained the model on the training set by adjusting parameters to minimize prediction errors.
Optimized model performance by tuning hyperparameters using techniques like cross-validation or grid search.
iv) 📊 Model Evaluation
Pizza Sales by Week
This process begins by aggregating pizza sales on a weekly basis, converting the order_date to a datetime format for accurate grouping.
The data is then split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets to prepare for model evaluation.
The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) function is defined to assess model performance by comparing actual and predicted values.
ARIMA Model Tuning
The ARIMA model is tuned using a grid search over specified values of p, d, and q parameters to find the optimal configuration.
The model forecasts sales for the test set, and the best MAPE score and corresponding parameters are printed.
The predicted values are formatted for display, allowing for easy comparison with actual sales.
Finally, a line plot visualizes the actual vs. predicted weekly sales, helping to evaluate the ARIMA model's forecasting performance.
Best SARIMA Model Training and Output
The SARIMA model is trained with orders (1, 1, 1) for ARIMA and seasonal components.
It forecasts sales for the test set, calculating the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) for accuracy assessment.
The best MAPE score is printed to evaluate model performance.
Predictions are formatted for easy comparison with actual sales.
A line plot visualizes actual vs. predicted weekly sales, aiding in performance evaluation.
Prophet Model Forecasting
The order_date column is converted to datetime format and renamed to 'ds' for dates and 'y' for target values.
The Prophet model is fitted to the prepared data, with US country holidays included for enhanced accuracy.
Future dates for the next 7 days are generated to predict sales.
The forecast results are displayed using Prophet's built-in plotting functionality.
Regression Model
Data Preparation: Converts order_date to datetime and aggregates weekly sales.
Feature Engineering: Creates features: week of the year, day of the week, month, and year.
Train-Test Split: Divides data into 80% training and 20% testing sets.
Model Training: Trains a linear regression model on the training set.
Model Evaluation: Calculates and prints MAPE for accuracy assessment.
Visualization: Plots actual vs. predicted weekly sales for performance evaluation.
LSTM Model for Weekly Sales
Weekly sales data is aggregated and split into training (80%) and test sets, then normalized using MinMaxScaler.
Sequences are created for LSTM input, and an LSTM model is trained to predict sales.
The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is calculated to evaluate the model's accuracy.
A plot compares actual vs. predicted weekly sales, assessing the LSTM model's performance.
